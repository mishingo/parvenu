              <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
              
              <p>The Parvenu Websites may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.

The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Parvenu pages, or register with Parvenu's Websites or services, a cookie helps Parvenu to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Parvenu Website, the information provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Parvenu features that you customized.</p>

You can also set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Parvenu services or Websites you visit.</p>
              
              <p>Parvenu may combine the information it collects through cookies, with other information it has collected from you. This information may be used to improve its Websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor its communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of its advertising, and for other internal business purposes. In addition, Parvenu may combine any financial account information that you provide for a purchase, with other personal information in order to complete a sale or transaction, or honor a return policy. By providing your financial account information along with personal information, you are hereby specifically opting-in and consenting to Parvenu combining this information.</p>
