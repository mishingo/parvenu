              <p>At PARVENU, WE GET WOMEN. Real women live ever more complicated lives. They juggle more activities, play more roles and carry more expectations.</p>
              
              <p>But what women value is what they have always valued: connecting with others, making smart choices, looking and feeling great. Living life fully means women choose to play all their roles with confidence and style.</p>
              
              <p>That is why we’re here.</p>
              
              <p>For more than half a century, we have evolved with the needs of real women who live full, active lives. Our values are her values. We get that a woman expresses herself through what she wears – at work, at home and at play.</p>
              
              <p>To meet her needs, we design pieces for her life and her changing roles to help her look and feel confident and beautiful. We create rich experiences that connect with her wherever she is, inspire her style and simplify her choices.</p>
              
              <p>Parvenu associates are committed to and driven by a simple but profound mission – ‘to inspire and connect with our clients to put their best selves forward every day’. This is evident in our great brands as well as in our commitment to operating our business responsibly and thoughtfully. This commitment means that our clients can look great and feel great about the clothes they wear, and it means that as a business we are holding ourselves to high standards. It means forging strong partnerships with our suppliers so that products are made ethically. It means investing in new programs and innovation to minimize our impact on the environment. And it means making meaningful contributions to our communities.</p>
              
              <p>Parvenu’s rich heritage dates to 1954, when founder Miguel Ramos opened his first shop called Parvenu. Back then, “Parvenu” represented a best-selling dress style that had been gifted to the storeowner by his father. The “Parvenu” design embodied the well-dressed woman, and the legacy was born. By 1983, Parvenu had grown from a regional brand to a national brand with 47 stores across the United States.</p>
              
              <p>The Company operated 1,025 Parvenu stores in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada as of February 1, 2014. Our brand is also available in more than 100 countries worldwide online at Parvenu.com.</p>
              
              <p>At Parvenu, we champion the modern working woman and her love of fashion in everything we do. That’s why for generations we have been her go-to style destination, always leading her with love. Parvenu is much more than a high-quality collection of beautiful wear now pieces. We offer a unique combination of fashion, work and flattering fit. Our goal is always to unleash her confidence, femininity and feeling of success – making her shine.</p>
